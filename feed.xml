<p>The Asia-Pacific Primary Liver Cancer Expert (APPLE) Association was established in 2013. The main objective of the association is to promote the scientific advancement of and education in liver cancer management in the Asia-Pacific region, where 80% of global liver cancer deaths occur, including the exchange of information and the development of consensus in the field of liver cancer. More details <a href="https://www.applecongress.org/apple/main.php">here</a>.</p>

<p>The APPLE Association launched the educational program “APPLE Academy” in 2019. This program has since become a crucial platform for aspiring doctors and medical professionals interested in liver cancer.</p>

<p>During the event, Prof. Alfred Cheng participated in session 4: FROM APPLE ACADEMY INTO THE FUTURE and delivered a talk on the topic “What Clinicians Should Know about Translational Cancer Research?”.</p>

<p>The AACR continues its relentless pursuit to prevent and cure all cancers. As the world’s first and largest cancer research organization, it boasts a membership exceeding 54,000 professionals from more than 130 countries. These members are at the vanguard in the global battle against cancer.</p>

<p>During the meeting, our team had the opportunity to present a poster showcasing our latest research findings. This was not only a platform for us to disseminate our work but also a fertile ground for sharing ideas and engaging in thought-provoking discussions with researchers from around the world.</p>

<p><strong>CU Medicine uncovers the keys for liver cancer adaptation to immunotherapy</strong></p>

<p>Liver cancer remains one of the most common cancers in the world. Recent research from CUHK’s Faculty of Medicine has discovered how liver cancer cells adapt to immunotherapy, the most advanced therapy for cancer patients. The team empowered immunotherapy by counteracting the resistance mechanisms of cancer cells and confirmed their clinical potential in liver cancer animal models. Research results have been published in the leading international journal Gut. The team is also going to commence a new Phase II clinical trial of combination immunotherapy, aiming to translate the discovery into patient benefits.</p>
