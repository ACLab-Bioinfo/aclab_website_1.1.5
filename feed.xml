<p>Dr. Zhong joined us in November 2020 and since then he has contributed significantly to our research. Dr. Zhong is a hepatobiliary surgeon. He is always willing to guide us mouse model surgery. He has also been a great colleague and friend, always ready to share his insights and experiences with us. We are grateful for his dedication and enthusiasm, and we wish him all the best in his future endeavors. We hope to keep in touch with him and continue our cooperation in the future.</p>

Recent research from CUHK’s Faculty of Medicine has discovered how liver cancer cells adapt to immunotherapy, the most advanced therapy for cancer patients. The team comprising the School of Biomedical Sciences (SBS) members Prof. Alfred Cheng Sze-lok, Professor; Prof. Zhou Jingying, Assistant Professor and Dr. Xiong Zhewen, Postdoctoral Fellow and other researchers empowered immunotherapy by counteracting the resistance mechanisms of cancer cells and confirmed their clinical potential in liver cancer animal models. Research results have been published in the leading international journal Gut, which can be viewed <a href="https://gut.bmj.com/content/72/9/1758.long">HERE</a>. The team is also going to commence a new Phase II clinical trial of combination immunotherapy (NCT05873244), aiming to translate the discovery into patient benefits.</p>

<p>Recently, immunotherapy has increasingly been given to patients in the clinic. However, checkpoint inhibitors, the most used immunotherapy in liver cancer, can only benefit approximately 20% of patients. Moreover, patients who initially respond can become resistant during treatment.</p>

<p>Immunotherapy-resistant liver cancer patients are associated with an immunosuppressive cold tumour microenvironment. However, the animal models commonly used in the laboratory do not reflect the complex organ-specific aspects of tumour development. Advances in modelling dynamic tumour-immune interactions are therefore critical to understand resistance mechanisms and improve immunotherapy. The new clinically relevant mouse models are instrumental in identifying and verifying actionable targets for therapeutic interventions. The team has further used their new mouse models to demonstrate the effectiveness and safety of a novel class-I HDAC drug in combination with checkpoint inhibitors.</p>

<p>Prof. WANG Jia has long been involved in the establishment and maintenance of stem cell pluripotency and the mechanism of tumorigenesis and development, and his main research interests include 3D genome and gene expression regulation, 3D genome structure variation and tumorigenesis, and phase separation with 3D genome. Research has been published in Cell Stem Cell、Cell Research、Stem Cell Reports、Journal of Pathology、Oncogene、Cancer Letters et. al. Prof. WANG Jia’s team was the first to report that phase separation can directly regulate the re-organization of TAD (topologically associated structural domain), and were selected as the cover article of Volume 10 of the 28th issue of <em>Cell Stem Cell</em>. <em>Nature Structural &amp; Molecular Biology</em> highly praised the discovery and selected as <a href="https://www.nature.com/nsmb/articles?type=research-highlight&amp;year=2021">one of the top 12 breakthrough scientific achievements in the world in 2021</a>.</p>]]></content><author><name>Yiling</name></author><category term="Meeting" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are happy to have Prof. WANG Jia and his team for a visit and academic communication.
