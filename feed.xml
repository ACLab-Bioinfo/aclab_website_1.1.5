The JRS is funding 10 projects at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), while the CRS is funding two. Among the eight University Grants Committee (UGC)-funded universities, CUHK is the leader in the number of projects funded by the JRS and the total number funded by both schemes.</p>

<p>The NSFC/RGC JRS and CRS support research proposals jointly submitted by mainland and Hong Kong researchers. The JRS aims to promote collaboration between researchers and research teams in Hong Kong and the mainland by complementing the existing strengths of both sides, while the CRS aims to support larger-scale collaborative research across disciplines and universities in the mainland and Hong Kong, with a view to enhancing the research output and impact of both.</p>

<p>CUHK’s Pro-Vice-Chancellor Professor Sham Mai-har said, “The NSFC/RGC Schemes serve as catalysts that link researchers and research teams from Hong Kong and mainland China together to unlock new frontiers of knowledge. It brings me great joy to witness that CUHK researchers are engaged in high-calibre collaborative projects with their mainland counterparts. With the steadfast support of the NSFC and RGC, I envisage a future when researchers from both regions complement their individual strengths to orchestrate a symphony of innovation that yields transformative research outcomes.”</p>

<p>They first visited Life Science Popularization Museum, a place promoting, showcasing, and providing a recreational experience of cellular life. This museum, with a total area of about 700 square meters, heavily uses advanced technologies like holographic projections, 3D curved screens, rail TVs, multimedia touch screens, AR, and VR to enable immersive experiences and learning about cell biology and its role in human aging, diseases, and regeneration.</p>

<p>Next stop is 2023 Health and Talent Development Themed Salon, where the experts participated in activities and shared their insights. The event included welcoming speeches and a keynote address from various officials and university representatives.

<p>肝癌是本港三大致命癌症之一。中大研究團隊指出，最常用的免疫治療「免疫檢查點抑制劑」，只對大約兩成患者有作用，而部分人更可能出現耐藥性。</p>

<p>中大團隊用了一年多時間，建立兩個對免疫治療耐藥的小鼠模型，了解病人出現肝癌耐藥的原理。</p>

<p>中大醫學院助理院長(研究)鄭詩樂表示：「當癌細胞適應了免疫治療的攻擊後，就會釋放一些訊號出來，找了身體中對身體不好的免疫細胞、所謂『免疫抑制細胞』，就幫癌細胞一起對抗身體的T細胞。」</p>

<p>了解到耐藥原理後，如何改善肝癌細胞的耐藥情況？團隊在小鼠身上發現，透過利用一隻可克服免疫治療耐藥性的抑制劑，配合免疫治療，就可大幅提高T細胞與免疫抑制細胞的比率，有效消除腫瘤，延長病人生存期。</p>

<p>鄭詩樂指出：「當我們聯用、『雙劍合壁』時，我們見到腫瘤縮到非常小，是很顯著效果。逾七成小鼠可有完全治療及可大大延長其存活率。這裡看是約150日，但我們再長些，七個月、八個月、九個月，我們都見到很多老鼠都是很活躍，繼續生存。」</p>

<p>團隊下月會招募約40名曾接受抑制劑治療但出現抗藥性的病人，做臨床試驗。今次研究成果，已在國際權威雜誌發表。</p>

Recent research from CUHK’s Faculty of Medicine has discovered how liver cancer cells adapt to immunotherapy, the most advanced therapy for cancer patients.</p>

<p>The team comprising the School of Biomedical Sciences (SBS) members Prof. Alfred Cheng Sze-lok, Professor; Prof. Zhou Jingying, Assistant Professor and Dr. Xiong Zhewen, Postdoctoral Fellow and other researchers empowered immunotherapy by counteracting the resistance mechanisms of cancer cells and confirmed their clinical potential in liver cancer animal models. Research results have been published in the leading international journal Gut, which can be viewed <a href="https://gut.bmj.com/content/72/9/1758.long">HERE</a>. The team is also going to commence a new Phase II clinical trial of combination immunotherapy (NCT05873244), aiming to translate the discovery into patient benefits.</p>

<p>Recently, immunotherapy has increasingly been given to patients in the clinic. However, checkpoint inhibitors, the most used immunotherapy in liver cancer, can only benefit approximately 20% of patients. Moreover, patients who initially respond can become resistant during treatment.</p>

<p>Immunotherapy-resistant liver cancer patients are associated with an immunosuppressive cold tumour microenvironment. However, the animal models commonly used in the laboratory do not reflect the complex organ-specific aspects of tumour development. Advances in modelling dynamic tumour-immune interactions are therefore critical to understand resistance mechanisms and improve immunotherapy. The new clinically relevant mouse models are instrumental in identifying and verifying actionable targets for therapeutic interventions. The team has further used their new mouse models to demonstrate the effectiveness and safety of a novel class-I HDAC drug in combination with checkpoint inhibitors.</p>

<p>Prof. WANG Jia has long been involved in the establishment and maintenance of stem cell pluripotency and the mechanism of tumorigenesis and development, and his main research interests include 3D genome and gene expression regulation, 3D genome structure variation and tumorigenesis, and phase separation with 3D genome. Research has been published in Cell Stem Cell、Cell Research、Stem Cell Reports、Journal of Pathology、Oncogene、Cancer Letters et. al. Prof. WANG Jia’s team was the first to report that phase separation can directly regulate the re-organization of TAD (topologically associated structural domain), and were selected as the cover article of Volume 10 of the 28th issue of <em>Cell Stem Cell</em>. <em>Nature Structural &amp; Molecular Biology</em> highly praised the discovery and selected as <a href="https://www.nature.com/nsmb/articles?type=research-highlight&amp;year=2021">one of the top 12 breakthrough scientific achievements in the world in 2021</a>.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Meeting" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are happy to have Prof. WANG Jia and his team for a visit and academic communication.
