<p>肝癌是本港三大致命癌症之一。中大研究團隊指出，最常用的免疫治療「免疫檢查點抑制劑」，只對大約兩成患者有作用，而部分人更可能出現耐藥性。</p>

<p>中大團隊用了一年多時間，建立兩個對免疫治療耐藥的小鼠模型，了解病人出現肝癌耐藥的原理。</p>

<p>中大醫學院助理院長(研究)鄭詩樂表示：「當癌細胞適應了免疫治療的攻擊後，就會釋放一些訊號出來，找了身體中對身體不好的免疫細胞、所謂『免疫抑制細胞』，就幫癌細胞一起對抗身體的T細胞。」</p>

<p>了解到耐藥原理後，如何改善肝癌細胞的耐藥情況？團隊在小鼠身上發現，透過利用一隻可克服免疫治療耐藥性的抑制劑，配合免疫治療，就可大幅提高T細胞與免疫抑制細胞的比率，有效消除腫瘤，延長病人生存期。</p>

<p>鄭詩樂指出：「當我們聯用、『雙劍合壁』時，我們見到腫瘤縮到非常小，是很顯著效果。逾七成小鼠可有完全治療及可大大延長其存活率。這裡看是約150日，但我們再長些，七個月、八個月、九個月，我們都見到很多老鼠都是很活躍，繼續生存。」</p>

<p>團隊下月會招募約40名曾接受抑制劑治療但出現抗藥性的病人，做臨床試驗。今次研究成果，已在國際權威雜誌發表。</p>

Recent research from CUHK’s Faculty of Medicine has discovered how liver cancer cells adapt to immunotherapy, the most advanced therapy for cancer patients.</p>

<p>The team comprising the School of Biomedical Sciences (SBS) members Prof. Alfred Cheng Sze-lok, Professor; Prof. Zhou Jingying, Assistant Professor and Dr. Xiong Zhewen, Postdoctoral Fellow and other researchers empowered immunotherapy by counteracting the resistance mechanisms of cancer cells and confirmed their clinical potential in liver cancer animal models. Research results have been published in the leading international journal Gut, which can be viewed <a href="https://gut.bmj.com/content/72/9/1758.long">HERE</a>. The team is also going to commence a new Phase II clinical trial of combination immunotherapy (NCT05873244), aiming to translate the discovery into patient benefits.</p>

<p>Recently, immunotherapy has increasingly been given to patients in the clinic. However, checkpoint inhibitors, the most used immunotherapy in liver cancer, can only benefit approximately 20% of patients. Moreover, patients who initially respond can become resistant during treatment.</p>

<p>Immunotherapy-resistant liver cancer patients are associated with an immunosuppressive cold tumour microenvironment. However, the animal models commonly used in the laboratory do not reflect the complex organ-specific aspects of tumour development. Advances in modelling dynamic tumour-immune interactions are therefore critical to understand resistance mechanisms and improve immunotherapy. The new clinically relevant mouse models are instrumental in identifying and verifying actionable targets for therapeutic interventions. The team has further used their new mouse models to demonstrate the effectiveness and safety of a novel class-I HDAC drug in combination with checkpoint inhibitors.</p>
