# Biography
Prof. CHENG Sze Lok Alfred is a Professor in the School of Biomedical Sciences and Assistant Dean (Research) of the Faculty of Medicine at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK). He completed his Ph.D. under the supervision of Prof. Joseph Sung in the Department of Medicine and Therapeutics at CUHK in 2002 and went on his postdoctoral training in Ohio State University until 2007. Prof. Cheng has published in international journals including Molecular Cell, Nature Genetics, Journal of Clinical Investigation, Cancer Research, Gastroenterology, Gut, Journal of Hepatology, Nature Communications and Nucleic Acids Research. He has received >20 academic honors and awards, including recognitions from the American Association of Cancer Research (AACR) and United European Gastroenterology (UEG). He was a recipient of the Most Promising Young Investigator Award by Hong Kong Government (2014) and CUHK (2015). He has been recently awarded the Asa Briggs Visiting Fellowship in 2017 by the University of Sussex and the Visiting Professorship in 2018 by the Southwestern Medical University. Until 2019, he has presided as Principal Investigator (PI)/co-PI in ~30 local and national competitive grants with a sum of over 90 million HK dollars. His current research focuses on the epigenetic mechanisms in tumors and their microenvironment, aiming at the enhancement of cancer immunotherapy.
